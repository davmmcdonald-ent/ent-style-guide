<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p class="page-description">Welcome to the Ent Credit Union Web Design System! This system is designed to help you create beautiful, consistent, and accessible user interfaces quickly and efficiently. By using our design system, you can ensure that all your projects adhere to the same high standards and best practices.</p>

<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>

<p>The Design Guidelines section provides the foundational standards and principles that guide the use and creation of design elements within our system. These guidelines ensure that all design work aligns with our core values and maintains consistency across all projects.</p>

<h3>High-Level Standards and Principles</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Maintaining a uniform look and feel across all digital products is crucial. Consistency helps users feel familiar with our interfaces and enhances their overall experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Designing interfaces that are usable by people of all abilities is a top priority. Our guidelines ensure that all components and interactions are accessible, meeting or exceeding industry standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Our components and design patterns are built to scale. This means they can be reused and adapted across various projects, ensuring efficiency and reducing redundancy.</li>
    <li><strong>Usability</strong>: Our design system emphasizes creating intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that users can accomplish their tasks with minimal effort and confusion.</li>
</ul>

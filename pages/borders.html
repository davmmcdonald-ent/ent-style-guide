<h1>Borders</h1>
<p class="page-description">Our design system embraces the use of rounded edges and soft borders to create a modern, friendly, and visually appealing interface. Rounded edges contribute to a more approachable and comfortable user experience, while soft borders help in subtly defining sections without being too harsh or intrusive. Additionally, shading is used to enhance the visual hierarchy and depth, giving elements a sense of layering and prominence.</p>

    <h2>Border Width and Radius</h2>
    <p>We have standardized the border radius and width options to ensure consistency across the site.</p>
    <div class="borders">
        <div class="borders__box" style="border-radius: 24px 0 0 0;">24px</div>
        <div class="borders__box" style="border-radius: 8px 0 0 0;">8px</div>
        <div class="borders__box" style="border-radius: 2px 0 0 0;">2px</div>
    </div>
    <h3>Use case examples:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>24px Radius:</strong> This is our default radius, applied to most rounded background flood boxes, cards, buttons, image boxes, and other similar elements.</li>
        <li><strong>8px Radius:</strong> Used for smaller elements where a 24px radius might feel excessive, such as form input fields.</li>
        <li><strong>2px Radius:</strong> Generally applied in situations where a subtle rounded edge is needed, or where a rounded border does not meet the necessary function or aesthetic requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For border widths, we primarily use <span class="code-inline">1px</span> colored borders. These are only used when it is necessary to define the edge of an enclosed section, such as a white card on a white background or light images. This subtle approach ensures that borders enhance the design without drawing too much attention or creating visual clutter.</p>
